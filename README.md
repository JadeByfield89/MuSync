MuSync
======

MuSync is an Android music player app. I had an idea for a social twist where you could see what your friends were listening to on their devices in real time, as well see what songs/artists were trending in your area or others. I've since scrapped the social aspect since Soundwave launched a couple weeks after I started this project. I still think it has potential to be a solid music player, which is why I've open sourced it so other devs can contribute/modify it as they see fit. 


As of this writing, MuSync uses these open source libraries.
